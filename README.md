# IP Notebook
 My notes for the year 2020-21 of Orchid's Computer Science with Python
 course/Informatics Practices (IP), CBSE Subject Code 065.
 
 It is recommended you view the notebook as a PDF (`python.pdf` and
`mysql.pdf`). If you're viewing the `.org` files (not recommended), it
is recommended that you use Emacs with `org-mode`. Note that this will
**not** show the output. You'll either have to locally execute the
code snippets, or cross-refer to the PDF.
